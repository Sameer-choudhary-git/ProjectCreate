# Deployment Fix for Vercel

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WebAssembly Cross-Origin Headers Issue
**Problem**: WebContainer requires specific COOP/COEP headers to work in production
**Solution**: Added `vercel.json` configuration file with the required headers

### 2. API Key Exposure in Console
**Problem**: Console.log statements were potentially exposing sensitive API responses
**Solution**: Removed all unnecessary console.log statements from both frontend and backend

## Files Modified

1. **vercel.json** - Added COOP/COEP headers for production deployment
2. **frontend/vite.config.ts** - Added preview headers configuration
3. **backend/src/index.ts** - Removed console.log that could expose API responses
4. **frontend/src/components/Workspace.tsx** - Removed console.log statements
5. **frontend/src/App.tsx** - Removed console.log statements
6. **frontend/src/components/PreviewFrame.tsx** - Removed console.log statements

## How to Redeploy

1. **Important**: Make sure to deploy from the `frontend` directory in Vercel
   - The `vercel.json` file is now located in the frontend folder
   - Set your Vercel project root directory to `frontend`

2. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add COOP/COEP headers and remove console logs"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → General
   - Set "Root Directory" to `frontend`
   - Redeploy the project

4. **Verify the fix:**
   - Check that the WebContainer preview works without DataCloneError
   - Verify no API keys are visible in browser console
   - Test the application functionality

## Key Configuration Added

The `vercel.json` file now includes:
- Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
- Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin

These headers enable WebAssembly serialization across workers, fixing the WebContainer issue.

## Security Notes

- API keys are properly secured in backend environment variables
- No sensitive data should appear in browser console anymore
- `.env` files are already gitignored for security
